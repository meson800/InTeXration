It integrates with GitHub using a webhook URL. On each commit the specified .tex-files are compiled to a PDF. You can include the url to this PDF and possibly the log file (which are both fixed) in your README.md to offer interested parties a compiled version of the document(s) in your repository.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\nThis project is in a very early development phase.
